[database]
# DuckDB database configuration

# For SSD storage, consider: batch_size=100, flush_interval=10

path = "data/mqtt_logs.db"

# Batch size - number of messages to accumulate in memory before writing to disk
# Higher values = fewer writes = better for SD cards, but more data loss risk

# Alternative settings: 1000 (balanced), 100 (SSD/frequent writes)
batch_size = 5000

# Flush interval - seconds between forced disk writes
# Higher values = less frequent writes = better for SD cards
